# Project Title

**ChileAtiende AI Multi‑Agent Assistant**

## Overview of the Idea

A multi‑agent artificial intelligence system that ingests, indexes, and reasons over all public information on *chileatiende.gob.cl*. It delivers clear answers to citizens’ questions about government services, saving them valuable time specially in older adults.

## Project Goal

Demonstrate a pipeline where autonomous agents crawl, structure, and continuously refresh ChileAtiende content, while a conversational agent provides reliable, citation‑backed answers in natural language.

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Ask** – User types or speaks a question (e.g., “How do I renew my passport?”).
2. **Understand** – NLU agent classifies intent and key entities.
3. **Retrieve** – Search agent queries a vector database built from ChileAtiende pages.
4. **Reason** – Answer‑generation agent combines retrieved snippets, checks consistency, and drafts a response with inline citations.
5. **Respond** – UI shows the answer, sources, and follow‑up suggestions.
6. **Feedback loop** – User can rate usefulness; reinforcement agent retrains ranking.

### Core Functionality

- Natural‑language Q&A with source citations

### Multimodal Elements

- **Text**: main interaction
- **Voice**: If supported by LLM

## Tools Used

- Firecrawl;

- Browser Use

## UI Aproach

Clean chat‑first interface with a right‑hand panel for cited snippets.

## Visuals

1. Chat screen showing answer with three citation cards.
2. Admin dashboard with crawl timeline and query heatmap.
